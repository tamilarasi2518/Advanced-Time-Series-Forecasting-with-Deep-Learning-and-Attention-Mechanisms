# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-Mechanisms
This project involves building and evaluating an advanced deep-learning time-series model using attention mechanisms. Students must use a complex dataset, optimize hyperparameters, compare with ARIMA and non-attention LSTMs, follow clean coding standards, and visualize attention weights to interpret model focus.
